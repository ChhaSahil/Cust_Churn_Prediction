# Cust_Churn_Prediction
Objective: To identify potential churn among bank customers(Kaggle Dataset) using Extreme Gradient Boosting
and deployed a Docker containerized Streamlit App, which uses the trained model for prediction.
Evaluated different classifier models on the validation dataset through StratifiedKFold Cross Validation to achieve a
mean precision score of 0.93 and mean recall score of 0.88 with the use of XGBoost classifier.
